An Interactive Quiz Application is a web-based application designed to test users’ knowledge through a series of questions and provide instant feedback. This project is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are core technologies of web development. The main objective of this application is to create an engaging, user-friendly platform where users can answer multiple-choice questions and receive their scores at the end of the quiz.

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to create the basic structure of the quiz application. It defines the layout of the web page, including elements such as the quiz title, question area, answer options, buttons, and score display. Each question and its corresponding options are organized using HTML tags, ensuring that the content is well-structured and accessible.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to enhance the visual appearance of the quiz application. It helps in designing an attractive and responsive user interface by controlling colors, fonts, spacing, alignment, and layout. CSS makes the application visually appealing and improves user experience by providing clear visibility of questions and options. Features such as hover effects, button styling, and responsive design allow the quiz to adapt to different screen sizes, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.

JavaScript is the core technology that adds interactivity and functionality to the quiz application. It is responsible for displaying questions dynamically, handling user input, validating answers, and calculating the final score. JavaScript uses event handling to detect user actions such as selecting an option or clicking the “Next” button. It also controls the flow of the quiz by moving from one question to the next and tracking the user’s progress throughout the quiz.

The quiz application typically consists of multiple-choice questions stored in an array or object format within JavaScript. Each question includes a set of options and a correct answer. When the user selects an answer, the application checks whether it is correct and updates the score accordingly. At the end of the quiz, the final score is displayed along with a message indicating the user’s performance.
One of the key advantages of this interactive quiz application is that it provides instant feedback, which helps users understand their strengths and areas for improvement. It can be used in educational institutions for practice tests, self-assessment, and learning reinforcement. The application can also be extended by adding features such as a timer, difficulty levels, random question generation, or a leaderboard.

In conclusion, the Interactive Quiz Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript demonstrates the effective use of front-end web technologies to build a functional and engaging web application. This project enhances problem-solving skills, improves understanding of JavaScript logic, and provides practical experience in creating interactive web pages. It is a useful and scalable application that can be adapted for various educational and training purposes
